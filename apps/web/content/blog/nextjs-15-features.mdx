# What's New in Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings significant improvements to performance, developer experience, and application capabilities. Let's dive into the most exciting features.

## Enhanced App Router

The App Router continues to evolve with improved streaming capabilities and better data fetching patterns. Server Components are now more powerful than ever.

### Key Improvements

- **Partial Prerendering**: Combine static and dynamic content seamlessly

- Up to 700x faster updates than Webpack
- Optimized for large-scale applications
- Better hot module replacement

## Server Actions

Server Actions make it easier than ever to handle form submissions and mutations:

```typescript
async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  'use server';

  const title = formData.get('title');
  // Save to database
}
```

## Improved Image Optimization

The `next/image` component now includes:

- Better placeholder generation
- Automatic format detection
- Enhanced lazy loading

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 represents a major leap forward in web development. The framework continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with React while maintaining excellent developer experience.
